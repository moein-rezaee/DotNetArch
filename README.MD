# **DotNetArch: Simplify Clean Architecture Setup**  

#### **Introduction**  

DotNetArch is a .NET global tool designed to help developers quickly set up solutions following Clean Architecture principles and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). This tool streamlines the creation of well-structured .NET projects, saving time and effort while adhering to industry standards.  

---

#### **Requirements**  

Before using DotNetArch, ensure your system meets the following requirements:  

1. **.NET SDK**: Version 6.0 or higher (recommended: .NET 9.0).  
   - Install it from the official [.NET Downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).  
2. **Operating System**:  
   - **Windows**: Windows 10 or higher.  
   - **macOS**: macOS Catalina or higher.  
   - **Linux**: Any distribution supporting .NET Core.  
3. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed if you plan to clone or contribute.  

To check your .NET version, run:  

```bash
dotnet --version
```  

---

#### **How to Install and Use the NuGet Package**  

**Step 1: Install the Tool**  
You can install DotNetArch globally via NuGet with the following command:  

```bash
dotnet tool install --global DotNetArch
```  

**Step 2: Update the Tool**  
To ensure you have the latest version of the tool:  

```bash
dotnet tool update --global DotNetArch
```  

**Step 3: Generate a Clean Architecture Solution**  
Once installed, you can use the tool to create a solution structure:  

```bash
dotnet arch
```

This command generates the following layers:

- **Core**
- **Application**
- **Infrastructure**
- **API**

#### Generate CRUD for an Entity

After creating a solution you can scaffold a full CRUD vertical slice for an entity:

```bash
dotnet-arch new crud <SolutionName> <EntityName>
```

The tool creates domain models, repositories, unit of work, MediatR command/query handlers, validators, and API controllers. You can choose SQL Server or SQLite and generated code supports pagination via `PagedResult<T>`. Running the command again updates existing files instead of duplicating them.

#### **How to Clone and Run the Project**

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**  

To get the source code, clone the repository from GitHub:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moein-rezaee/DotNetArch.git
cd DotNetArch
```  

**Step 2: Build the Project**  

Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. Then, build the project:  

```bash
dotnet build
```  

**Step 3: Run the Project**  

To test the functionality, you can execute the project locally:  

```bash
dotnet run
```

   ```  

3. **Make Your Changes**:  
   Ensure your code adheres to .NET coding guidelines.  

4. **Push and Submit a Pull Request**:  
   Push your changes and open a pull request to the main repository.
